# ShanksBot-RS

A rust implementation of the ShanksBot shown by Matt Parker in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmfxIhmGPP4).

It counts the number of decimals of a reciprocal of a given prime* number before they start repeating.

*it is supposed to be used on prime numbers, but any positive integer will work.

## How to use

If you have cargo installed, simply run ```cargo install shanksbot-rs```

## What's the practical use of this?
There is none that I know of. It was just a fun little exercise. While watching the video.
